        Okay, so we need to specify "groups".

        A group is a unit of work.  It consists of a title, a directory of where
        to save downloads, filters, and post processors to run against said downloads.

        For the post processors (par-repair, unrar, avi-merge) you dont need to 
        specify a path if it is in your PATH environment variable, if it isn't
        however, we need to know where it's located, so add the following node.
         <path>/some/path/to/unrar</path>
    -->
    
    <group title="Movies">
        <!-- where are we doing the saving and what not -->
